## model

A pneumonia classifier was used to classify X-RAY images into {PNEUMONIA, NORMAL}.

The model was trained using the data provided in the next section and following [this step by step tutorial on how to train an image classifier with Teachable Machine](https://youtu.be/ybh9p3QOYrs).

The trained model is available in my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ComputerVisionEngineer).
